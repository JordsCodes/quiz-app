# QuizBiz

This app was created as my final group project with @CommandShiftHQ. It is a custom quiz generator which sources questions from the Open Trivia Database API.

The dependencies for this project are React, Node.js and axios.

## Installation

Navigate to the desired directory in your terminal and run: 

`git clone https://github.com/JordsCodes/quiz-app`

Install Node Project Manager:

`npm install`

## Usage

To start the app, navigate to the app's root directory and run: 

`npm start`

The app takes parameters for category, difficulty and amount of questions.

Note that the "amount" parameter is limited by the amount of questions which actually exist for a particular set of parameters. 

If the user would like to access the leaderboard, they must create an account. User information is stored in Google's Firebase service.

Please see our project's presentation video for a demonstration of the app and information on the development process:
